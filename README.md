### Designer's Comments
-------------------

Look carefully for specific instructions

replace all XXXXXXXX's with your Friend ID. I've recently updated the coding, hopefully I've fixed the problems. Sometime's it's easier to copy and past into Word and use the find and replace feature to find all the XXXXXXXX's.
